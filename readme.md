# sha_asm
Semi-optimized implementations of SHA-1 and parts of the SHA-2 family. This was
a learning exercise into the implementation of modern hash functions. While I've
done minimal testing to verify the hash functions' output is correct, everything
in this repository is assumed to be incorrect, and 100% vulnerable to timing
attacks unless proven otherwise.

# usage
While the licenses allows for using these implementations anywhere with
attribution, I kindly ask everyone to avoid doing so, and to look elsewhere for
production quality SHA implementations, for their own computer security's sake.
